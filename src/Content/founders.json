        "story": "Dorothy Dworkin was born to Wolf and Sara Goldstick in Windau, in the Courland Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Latvia).[1] She had six sisters and four brothers. In 1904, she immigrated with her family to Canada. In 1907, she chose to become a maternity nurse. She spent a year working under Dr. Kaufman and various of his colleagues until Dr. Kaufman suggested that she go to train at Mount Sinai Hospital, Cleveland, where she would train as a midwife.[2] Prior to leaving Toronto, she helped establish a free Jewish Dispensary located at Elizabeth Street near Agnes, which is now Dundas Street, with Ida Siegel and her brother Abe Lewis.[3] She was the dispensary's first nurse.[4] In 1909, she received a diploma from the Medical State Board of Ohio."
