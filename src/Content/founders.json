The growing need for a place to care for elderly Jews prompted the society to open the Jewish Old Folks' Home in a house at 31 Cecil Street in 1917. Slova Greenberg initiated this effort and was still leading the Ezras Noshem Society when it played an instrumental role in raising funds for and founding Mount Sinai Hospital on Yorkville Avenue, around 1922.<br /><br /><u>Instructions:</u> There are 3 caches, each cache contains a number.
